## Description
This is a Chat Bot made using Flutter Framework and using OpenAI's ChatGPT API released on March 1,2023. I have used Firebase to fetch API Key. Users can interact with it like a normal chat bot and it allows to change randomness of output of Chat Bot. It also understands context of previous and can generate output accordingly.

## Technologies used:
* Flutter
* OpenAI API
* Firebase

## Credits
This project was inspired from this [Course](https://github.com/RajKushwaha360/flutter_chat_bot/blob/master/apk-release/app-release.apk) on youtube. It has used OpenAI's other models, not ChatGPT (model gpt-3.5-turbo) as it was before the ChatGPT API released. Do check them out!
